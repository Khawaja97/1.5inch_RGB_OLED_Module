# 1.5inch_RGB_OLED_Module

This is a general RGB OLED display Module, 1.5inch diagonal, 128x128 pixels, 16-bit high color (65K colors), with embedded controller, communicating via SPI interface.

Look at the OLED_schematic.png to setup your circuit. Your circuit should exactly be the same for this to work. 

After that, download this repository and extract the files to a suitable location.

Then, open your arduino IDE, click on File and from the dropdown list, click Open.

Navigate to where you extracted the repository and select and open the OLED_Demo file.

Connect your arduino uno to your computer and upload the code.
